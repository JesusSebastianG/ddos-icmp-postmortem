## Overview
This repository contains a postmortem and a short playbook for a scenario-based DDoS incident involving an ICMP flood. All materials in this repository were created from a provided scenario and do not include real network traces, timestamps, or system-specific evidence.

## Included files
- `scenario.md` — Original scenario text (from the exercise).    
- `postmortem.md` — Formatted postmortem based only on the scenario.  
- `playbook_ddos.md` — Short response playbook for an ICMP-flood incident (scenario-based).  
- `evidence/` — Placeholder folder (no real evidence included).  
- `evidence/README.md` — Explains there is no real evidence for this exercise.

## How to use
1. Read `scenario.md` to understand the exercise constraints.  
2. Read `postmortem.md` and `playbook_ddos.md` for a structured NIST CSF based response (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).

## Notes
- All content is scenario-based and hypothetical. No real logs, PCAP files, or timestamps are included.
